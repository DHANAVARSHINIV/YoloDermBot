# YoloDermBot
Real-time detection with voice interaction
#  YOLOv12-based Dark Circle Detection Video Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered video chatbot that:
- Uses a YOLOv12-trained model to detect **dark circles** via webcam
- Gives **real-time spoken feedback** using `pyttsx3`
- Saves the final prediction + audio into a video

##  Features

- Real-time webcam feed with bounding box detection
- Text-to-speech (TTS) response while processing
- 10-second automated run and exit
- Saves a final `.mp4` with both detection and voice
- Custom-trained on Roboflow using YOLOv12
